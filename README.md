# Mini-Project
I have created a simple project as it is my first one so , by using HTML and CSS created a responsive website and along with the frond page i attached 3 more pages linked with (Home, About and Services). I have used all the Semantic tags and made it to look more attractive by using CSS.
I tried to create "Diva Web Design" which consists of Home(active), About and Services(dummy text).
